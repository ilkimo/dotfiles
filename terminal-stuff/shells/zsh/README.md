.p10k.zsh -> /home/il_kimo/repos/dotfiles/terminal-stuff/shells/zsh/.p10k.zsh
 .zshrc.bak -> /home/il_kimo/repos/dotfiles/terminal-stuff/shells/zsh/.zshrc.bak
 .zshrc.zni -> /home/il_kimo/repos/dotfiles/terminal-stuff/shells/zsh/.zshrc.zni
 .zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh -> /home/il_kimo/repos/dotfiles/terminal-stuff/shells/zsh/.zshrc
